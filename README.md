# pant-top-view-segmentation

As Homework in the Introduction to digital agriculture course at Skoltech. I did a basic photo segmentation code using the CV2 library, having a know distance between the plant and the camera we can approximate the pixels of the segmented area to the area of the plant's leaves. Later an advanced version of it was used for my MSc thesis.
